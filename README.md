# Assignment-Blockchain

This is a simplified Python implementation of a blockchain, which includes features such as block structure, initialization, adding blocks, transaction handling, and basic proof-of-work mining. It also provides a basic command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction. Please note that this implementation is for educational purposes and should not be used in production environments without significant enhancements and security measures.


The blockchain CLI provides several options for interacting with the blockchain:

### Adding Transactions

To add a transaction to the pending transactions list:

1. Choose option `1` from the menu.
2. Enter the sender's address.
3. Enter the recipient's address.
4. Enter the transaction amount.

### Mining Blocks

To mine a new block and add it to the blockchain:

1. Choose option `2` from the menu.
2. Enter the miner's reward address (where the mining reward will be sent).

### Displaying the Blockchain

To display the entire blockchain:

1. Choose option `3` from the menu.

### Validating the Blockchain

To check the validity of the blockchain:

1. Choose option `4` from the menu.
2. The program will display whether the blockchain is valid or not.
